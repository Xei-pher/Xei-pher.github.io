# Projects

Here are some of the key cybersecurity projects I've worked on:

1. **DVWA Hacking**  
   A comprehensive exploration of vulnerabilities using the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA). This project included exploiting various vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.

2. **Juice Shop Hacking**  
   Ethical hacking challenges with OWASP Juice Shop, identifying security vulnerabilities in an intentionally vulnerable web app.

3. **Mock IT Security Assessment (NIST Framework)**  
   Conducted a mock IT security audit using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Provided recommendations for improved security posture and adherence to industry standards.
