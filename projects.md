# Projects

Here are some of the key cybersecurity projects I've worked on:

---

### 1. **Python Keylogger with Payload Techniques**

Developed a Python-based keylogger with various payload delivery methods, including phishing emails and USB drop attacks. The keylogger captured keystrokes and sent the data via an email server, while employing **steganography** to hide malicious code in images for added stealth.

### 2. **Cybersecurity Home Lab**

This project documents my journey into creating a home lab, a sandboxed environment for testing cybersecurity tools and techniques. I set up:
- **Metasploitable 2/3 and vulnerable Windows VMs**
- **Ubuntu Server** for Blue Team activities
- **Kali Linux VM** for offensive security testing

Configured virtual networking, assigned static IPs, and fine-tuned Linux systems for user management, firewall configuration, and package installations. The lab setup provided valuable experience in networking fundamentals and Linux administration.

### 4. **Client Website Monitoring Service with Grafana and Prometheus**

Deployed a website monitoring service using **Grafana** and **Prometheus** to track client website health, SSL certificates, and uptime. Used **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization, ensuring real-time observability and proactive website maintenance during my internship at **SHIELD Foundry**.

### 6. **Wireshark Malware Analysis of OskiStealer**

Analyzed network traffic to identify **indicators of compromise (IoCs)** for the **OskiStealer** malware. Using **Wireshark**, I examined HTTP traffic and leveraged **VirusTotal** and **MalwareBazaar** to uncover the malware’s data exfiltration tactics and evasion methods.

### 7. **Building a SIEM with Azure Sentinel**

Developed a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system using **Microsoft Azure Sentinel**. The project involved setting up log collection, threat detection, and dashboards for real-time monitoring of Windows devices. Configured custom analytics rules and visualizations for tracking security events and potential threats.

### 8. **Enhancing Security with OSSEC: Comprehensive Setup and Testing**

Set up **OSSEC** as a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) in a virtualized environment. Configured the OSSEC server and Web UI on an Ubuntu VM, linked it to a Windows 10 VM agent, and simulated attacks from a **Kali Linux** VM to validate OSSEC’s detection capabilities.
